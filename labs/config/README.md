## Git configuration - Mac, Windows or Linux

Git comes with a tool called `git config` that lets you get and set configuration variables that control all aspects of how Git looks and operates. These variables can be stored in three different places:

- `/etc/gitconfig` file: Contains values applied to every user on the system and all their repositories. If you pass the option `--system` to `git config`, it reads and writes from this file specifically. Because this is a system configuration file, you would need administrative or superuser privilege to make changes to it.

- `~/.gitconfig` or `~/.config/git/config` file: Values specific personally to you, the user. You can make Git read and write to this file specifically by passing the `--global` option, and this affects all of the repositories you work with on your system.

- config file in the Git directory (that is, `.git/config`) of whatever repository youâ€™re currently using: Specific to that single repository. You can force Git to read from and write to this file with the `--local` option, but that is in fact the `default`. Unsurprisingly, you need to be located somewhere in a Git repository for this option to work properly.

Each level overrides values in the previous level, so values in `.git/config` trump those in `/etc/gitconfig`.

## Configure your Identity in git

Every Git commit uses this information, and itâ€™s immutably baked into the commits you start creating. You need to do this only once if you pass the `--global` option, because then Git will always use that information for anything you do on that system

```
git config --global user.name <Your name> # This 
git config --global user.email <Your email>
```

## Configure your editor
You can configure the default text editor that will be used when Git needs you to type in a message. If not configured, Git uses your systemâ€™s default editor.

```
git config --global core.editor pico
```

You can find the instructions to set up your favorite editor with Git in [git config core.editor commands](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/ch00/ch_core_editor)

## Your default branch name
By default Git will create a branch called master when you create a new repository with `git init`. From Git version 2.28 onwards, you can set a different name for the initial branch.

> For more background on this change, this statement from the [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/news/2020/jun/23/gitbranchname/) is an excellent place to look

To set main as the default branch name do:

```
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

## Checking your settings

After making changes check your configuration settings

```
git config --list
```

You can also check a specific keyâ€™s value by typing
```
git config user.name
```
