## Viewing the commit history

To look back into the commit history you can use the `git log` command. It's the most basic and powerful tool.

```
git log
```

    making my first commit

> By default, with no arguments, `git log` lists the commits made in that repository in reverse chronological order; that is, the most recent commits show up first. As you can see, this command lists each commit with its SHA-1 checksum, the author's name and email, the date written, and the commit message.

Git log has a huge number of options, lets take a look at some of the most popular:

- If you want to see some abbreviated stats for each commit.
    ```
    git log --stat
    ```

- To change the default log output you can use few prebuilt option values. The `oneline` value for this option prints each commit on a single line, which is useful if you're looking at a lot of commits. In addition, the `short`, `full`, and `fuller` values show the output in roughly the same format but with less or more information, respectively.
    ```
    git log --pretty=oneline
    ```

ðŸ“‹ Run the `git log` with `short`, `full`, and `fuller` and observe the differences.

- To specify your own log output format, you can use the `format` value.
```
git log --pretty=format:"%h - %an, %ar : %s"
```


|Specifier |	Description of Output
