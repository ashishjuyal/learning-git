## Making First Commit

Let's add the `README` file to the staging area and check the `git status`. You'll see `README` and `index.html` are staged for commit.

```
On branch master
No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   README
        new file:   index.html
```

Let's make our first commit:

```shell
# The commit command performs a commit, and the -m "message" adds a message.
git commit -m "making my first commit"
```

check the status:
```
git status
```

## Skipping the staging area
The staging area is amazingly useful for crafting commits exactly how you want them, however, sometimes you have a lot of modified files and you don't want to add them all one-by-one in the staging area. Sometimes it feels a bit more complex than you need in your workflow.

To skip the staging area, Git provides a simple shortcut. Adding the `-a` option to the `git commit` command makes Git automatically stage every file **`that is already tracked`** before doing the commit, letting you skip the `git add` part:

Let's make changes to `README` and use `git commit -a` to commit it without staging (skipping `git add`).
```
echo "Adding a new line to test git commit -a" >> README
git status
git commit -a -m "skipping the staging area"
```

ðŸ“‹ðŸŽ¤ Create a new file with some content and name it as `NOTES`. Use the `git commit -a` and check if it allows you to skip the staging area:

<details>
  <summary>Not sure how?</summary>

```shell
# creating a new file
echo "this file will contain my notes" > NOTES
git status
# this will not commit
git commit -a -m "trying to skip the staging area for a newfile NOTES"
git status
```
You will see the NOTES file was not committed. New files have to be added using `git add`. The `git commit -a` works only with already tracked files.

</details>

## Lab
In this lab you will create new files and commit the changes to git.

- create a two new files called `movies.md` and `books.md` and add your favourite movie/books names to it.
- print the repository short status.
- stage the file and commit the changes.
- edit the files again and add one more movie and book name to it.
- again print the repository short status.
- make a commit skipping the staging area.
